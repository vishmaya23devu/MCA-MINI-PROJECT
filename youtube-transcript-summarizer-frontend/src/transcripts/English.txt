Obviously, this is just,an example video here but when we release that, we can now see that there's,just white space shown at the start and end of the video, meaning that it's actually been removed or it's not gonna be in our finished video once we're done editing it down here. But down the bottom here,in the timeline area, you've got the bottom video track here which is a visual,representation of your video, so that you can quickly,see where everything is to jump between the different sections. Likewise, at the end of the video if we wanted to change,the ending of our video, remove maybe the q&a from a live stream, we can click and drag that,and pull it all the way back to where we want the video to finish. We can zoom in and out,on our timeline area down the bottom here, using,the zoom in and out buttons which will give us more detail or more control over the,edits that we're making. If we wanted this to be our,new start point for the video, that's now being set because we've moved that,start point to that point. You can access it from your,youtube studio dashboard area by coming over to content, finding the video that you want,to edit or make changes to. Top right corner here is,your preview or your playback of your video, and this,will show you the edits and changes that you're making here. The other way to get there is,to go to your youtube channel, go through and find the,video that you want to edit. So straight away, we,get these blue handles that have appeared on the,start and the end of our video. In this updated tutorial, we'll go step by step through the latest,youtube editor interface and the new features so that you can easily edit,or trim videos on youtube. Now at any time if you make a mistake or,you wanna undo anything, there's an undo and redo,buttons down the bottom here. Let's go up here to trim and cut and let's look at the,features that we've got in terms of removing stuff from our video Now, let's say for instancewe wanna remove a chunk or a section from inside the video itself, not the start, not the endsomething from the middle. If you are seeing this,and you can't hit save, then it's due to the end cards or the end screens that you've,got added on your video. So let's say we're happy with,this section we wanna remove, let's again hit the tick. So if we no longer want to,delete that section of our video, then we can remove that,cut that we've just added for that section. You can see that if i extend,that back out and keep the end of the video, that we're,now able to hit save. And again, we've got those red handles,that we can move around to highlight these section,that we want to take out. So anything that you're,leaving in this red area, this is the stuff that's,going to be removed. Let's say that there's,something around here that we wanna remove. So let's say i wanna,remove this section here where i'm talking about how our office and studio here got flooded. Again, this is gonna allow,us to take stuff away but not add new stuff in, but,also not move things around. It's gonna play back our video but you can see that it jumped,straight across that section. It's that if you know the actual time code of this section you wanna remove, then you can actually key,that in up here as well. So it's awesome that it's,actually shown up now while i'm recording this video. We can just hit the little checkbox here and that's gonna cut,that out of our video. We're gonna go and find the,section we wanna remove first. But again, this is all about,trimming and removing stuff from your videos that,are already on youtube And again, if you were having issues and you couldn't save,these things out before, then this is where you wanna,remove your end screens here to make changes, make,your edits to your videos and you can just do that by,selecting the element here, hitting the little trash can So if you do find that,you're gonna be in here making quite a few edits, then these things will definitely,speed up your workflow, like having the ability to zoom in and out just using these,shortcuts on your keyboard or to nudge that playback,head left or right. So if we zoom in here this last 20 seconds 'cause that's as long as,these end screens can show on screen, then we can actually,customize these elements to appear when we want them so you don't have to have,them on screen for 20 seconds. It doesn't happen all the time but if you are seeing that and you can't hit the save button, then you will need to remove,those end card elements first, which is what i'm gonna,cover off next anyway. So we could have our,subscribe button appear first, then our video creation workflow video and then maybe the best webcam,i've ever used appears third. And at any time, even if you,do hit save on your video and you edit sections out, you,can always come back in here to the youtube video editor. It says that it can take a few hours for your changes to applybut during that time your viewers will see the,original version of the video. You won't be able to go,and add other changes to the video until that,processing has happened. You can hit these three little,dots and you can revert back to the original video that,you uploaded to youtube. You can see that we can shorten this down to appear when maybe i mention in the video linked on screen,is this video or this video. But this is again for the last,20 seconds of your videos, you can have clickable links,on screen to other videos. So they only need to appear,when we want them to appear, as long as they're falling,within that 22nd gap. Again for more granularityfor more control and it will help you speed up,your process in here as well. Now because this is a,live video on the channel, i'm actually not gonna make these changes Another really cool feature in here though in terms of editing your videos, maybe helping you remove,any copyright issues or something you don't,want to show in the video is you can blur sections,of your video here too.  but after that's done, you'll,be able to select the face in the video that you want to,remove or you wanna blur out. Now if i zoom back out here so we can see the track in its entirety, you can see that it,actually doesn't stretch for the entire video 'cause our video is,longer than this track. So if you've uploaded,a video with no music and you want to come,in here and add music, then this is how easy it can be. So once you're done,adding your blur elements, you wanna make sure,that you're hitting save to save those changes. We can search for something specific or if you've gone through it and you've starred any,music in that library, it's gonna show up in here as well. We can click and drag to trim,off the start of that track and we can also do the,same to the end as well. We can reposition it, we can resize it, we can choose if it's,going to be a rectangle, if it's going to be an oval. Now if you do wanna do the,automatic face tracking for blur, we come up here to blur. We get the option to blur a,face or we get a custom blur. And this is where it's,gonna go through your video. So that blur is gonna be tracked,to an object in our video. Let's go back to say,the start of our video. So it's around here and we can have that blur,disappear at that point. Now we can also add in,multiple blur elements inside of your videos here as well. So let's go ahead here, click on this and we can either browse,through the huge library of music here Youtube's gonna remove any of the ad breaks that,are already in your video and it's automatically gonna add in one or more new ad breaks,that will be placed in natural gaps in your video. So now that you know how to,use the youtube video editor, if you're looking for,something more powerful, something more advanced, then check out the video linked on screen, where we look at the best,video editing software on mac and pc. So if you are creating,content where you are letting people know that,an ad is about to play, it's not something we've,done on our channel. And you can see that at,that point in the video that this video is gonna,show up in the top corner as a clickable link for someone to use. For a while, so in this video(haunting music) i'm gonna give you a,tour of where we work, where we shoot our youtube. So anywhere in the video,that we want to have a little card pop up in the top corner, this is where we can add,those in here as well. But in terms of adding,or editing these up, we can either hit the edit button up here or we can come down to,the edit button down here. It's gonna add one to that section and we can remove them,from up here as well. So i'm gonna go ahead and remove that and the other two ad,breaks that are in here. And if we come at the top,here to place automatically, then this is where it says Now whenever you're using music from the youtube audio library, it's a good idea to understand,the different licenses for the different tracks. Now just from specifying,these ad breaks doesn't mean that an ad is always going to play there.
